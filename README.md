💻 Developer CV Script
Welcome to my interactive Python Developer CV!
This project turns a traditional résumé into a small, executable Streamlit app —
because what better way to show your skills than through code itself?

🚀 Overview
This Streamlit app introduces me (Sargol Moslemi) as a developer, lists my technical skills,
and interactively highlights skillsets across different professional areas.

You can explore my areas of expertise and see which skills I use in each one.
